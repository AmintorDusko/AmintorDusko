Hi, My name is Amintor Dusko (@AmintorDusko) and I'm a Physicist.
-  I’m interested in Physics, coding, tensorial algebra, and to explore more efficient ways to implement algorithms. 
-  I code in c++, Python, and Fortran. I'm particularly interested in parallelism with openMP, MPI, and GPU.
-  I’m currently learning willing to expand my knowledge on GPU, and perhaps TPU.
