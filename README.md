Hi, My name is Amintor Dusko (@AmintorDusko) and I'm a quantum software developer/physicist.

I'm a seasoned Fortran, Python and modern C++ programmer super interested in solving real world problems. 

To do that I like to explore:
* Quantum Computing
* Quantum Machine Learning
* Quantum Devices and Simulators
* Condensed Matter Physics
* Quantum Devices and Simulators
* Tensor Networks and Calculus
